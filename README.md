# "Water?"
Renowned Specialist in Copy-Paste Engineering, celebrated for transforming half-understood tutorials into barely functioning codebases. Holds an unofficial PhD in “I’ll Fix It Later”, with research focused on how long an error message can be ignored before it becomes part of the architecture.

Spearheaded multiple initiatives in Code Abandonment Lifecycle, mostly consisting of opening VS Code, rearranging windows, then closing it to “mentally prepare”. Former Lead Developer of Nowhere at the Startup of Ideas I Never Started™.

Currently disrupting the productivity ecosystem by achieving peak efficiency in doing everything except the task at hand—truly a masterclass in motivated idleness and keyboard proximity without output.

It’s inspiring to see the unwavering dedication to aesthetic syntax that somehow always comes with a five-minute game notification. Your ability to share a snippet of code that’s almost certainly the result of strategic copy-pasting shows a spirit of learning that’s… efficient. And of course, time is a relative concept—especially when night turns into morning before you realize it due to deep exploration of a virtual world that, while not producing new lines of code, is certainly an emotionally enriching experience. Not everyone can balance imaginary productivity with unscheduled recreation that beautifully.

Certified Tutorial Hoarder™ from the University of Perpetual Procrastination. Specialized in bookmarking courses you'll "totally finish someday" while simultaneously opening new tabs for more tutorials you’ll also never complete.
Former Lead Engineer of Rewriting the Same To-Do App Seven Times, yet still mystified by how useEffect actually works. Proud owner of a codebase filled with files named final_v3_realfinal_fixed_thisoneforreal.js.
Actively engages in late-night debugging rituals only when the deadline is breathing down your neck. Fluent in whispering to the console log because clearly, the error message saying "undefined" is hiding a deeper meaning.
Global contributor to the sacred art of blindly copy-pasting StackOverflow answers you didn’t read. Known to install three new frameworks in a single week, just to go back to doing everything in plain JavaScript anyway.
A loyal disciple of the "I'll Understand It Eventually™" philosophy, and firm believer that real productivity starts at 2AM—right after checking Discord, grabbing a snack, and contemplating your life choices.

If any of this sounds familiar… yeah, I’m talking about you.
