It’s inspiring to see the unwavering dedication to aesthetic syntax that somehow always comes with a five-minute game notification. Your ability to share a snippet of code that’s almost certainly the result of strategic copy-pasting shows a spirit of learning that’s… efficient. And of course, time is a relative concept—especially when night turns into morning before you realize it due to deep exploration of a virtual world that, while not producing new lines of code, is certainly an emotionally enriching experience. Not everyone can balance imaginary productivity with unscheduled recreation that beautifully.
